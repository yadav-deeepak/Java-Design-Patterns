🧩 Singleton Design Pattern 
#############################
➤ Definition
***************
The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one object of a class is created during the entire application lifecycle and provides a global point of access to that object.

🧩 Why do we need Singleton?
******************************
➤ To control access to shared resources such as:
➤ Logging
➤ Database connection
➤ Caches
➤ Configuration settings
➤ Thread pools

🧩 Key Characteristics (Must-Know for Interviews)
***************************************************
➤ Only one instance exists.
➤ Lazy or Eager creation depending on design.
➤ Global access point (getInstance() method).
➤ Must be thread-safe in multi-threaded applications.
➤ Must prevent cloning, reflection, and serialization from breaking the Singleton property (important interview point).

🧩 Types of Singleton Implementations
***************************************
1) Eager Initialization (Simple & Thread-Safe)
===============================================
➤ Instance created at class loading time.

public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}

➤ Pros: Simple, thread-safe
➤ Cons: Instance created even if unused (memory waste)

2) Lazy Initialization (Not Thread-Safe)
===========================================
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

➤ Pros: Instance created only when needed
➤ Cons: Not thread-safe → multiple threads may create multiple instances

3) Thread-Safe Singleton (Synchronized Method)
==============================================
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null)
            instance = new Singleton();
        return instance;
    }
}

➤ Pros: Thread-safe
➤ Cons: Slow due to synchronization on every call

4) Double-Checked Locking (Best Performance)
==============================================
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

➤ Pros: Fast + thread-safe
➤ Cons: Slightly complex
➤ volatile is required to prevent instruction reordering

5) Bill Pugh (Static Inner Class) – The Best Recommended Approach
==================================================================
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}
    private static class Helper {
        private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    }
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return Helper.instance;
    }
}

➤ Pros:
➤ Lazy-loaded
➤ Thread-safe
➤ No synchronization overhead
➤ Cons: None — widely accepted as best practice

6) Enum Singleton (Most Robust)
=================================
public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;
}

➤ Pros:
➤ Prevents serialization issues
➤ Prevents reflection attacks
➤ Cons:
➤ Cannot be lazily loaded
➤ Less flexible (cannot extend another class)

🧩 How Singleton Protects Against Attacks
*******************************************
➤ Reflection attack
➤ Private constructor may still be accessed
➤ Fix → throw exception inside constructor

➤ Serialization attack
➤ Fix → implement readResolve()

➤ Cloning attack
➤ Fix → override clone to throw exception

🧩 Real-World Examples
************************
➤ Database connection manager (JDBC)
➤ Spring beans (by default Singleton scope)
➤ Logger frameworks (Log4j, SLF4J)
➤ Runtime class in Java (Runtime.getRuntime() is a singleton)

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Controlled access to a single shared resource
➤ Saves memory — only one instance
➤ Avoids inconsistent state
➤ Useful for centralized configurations

🧩 Disadvantages
*******************
➤ Hard to unit test (global state)
➤ Can become a God Object
➤ Can cause hidden dependencies
➤ Encourages tight coupling

############################
🧩 Factory Design Pattern
############################
🧩 Definition
***************
➤ The Factory Pattern (also called Factory Method Pattern) is a Creational Design Pattern that provides a way to create objects without exposing the object creation logic to the client.
➤ Instead of calling the constructor directly, the client uses a factory method to create objects.

🧩 Intent (Why Factory Method?)
*********************************
➤ To define an interface for creating objects but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
➤ Helps in creating objects when the exact type is determined at runtime.
➤ Provides loose coupling by eliminating direct dependency on concrete classes.

🧩 Key Characteristics (Must-Know for Interviews)
***************************************************
➤ Client uses factory instead of new.
➤ Reduces tight coupling between object creation and usage.
➤ Helps follow SOLID principles (especially OCP & SRP).
➤ Object type is selected based on input/logic.
➤ Easy to add new product types without modifying existing code.

🧩 When to Use Factory Pattern?
*********************************
➤ When you don’t know the exact object to create until runtime
➤ When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
➤ When object creation logic is complex
➤ When you want to centralize object creation
➤ When you want to reduce dependency on concrete classes

🧩 Real-World Examples
**************************
➤ Java Calendar.getInstance()
➤ JDBC DriverManager.getConnection()
➤ Spring Bean Factory / ApplicationContext
➤ NumberFormat.getInstance()
➤ Log4j LogManager

🧩 Simple Example — Without Factory (Problem)
================================================
Car car = new Swift();  // tightly coupled to Swift class

➤ Problem: If you want Baleno or Fortuner → modify code everywhere.

🧩 Using Factory Pattern (Solution)
======================================
Step 1: Create Product Interface
---------------------------------
public interface Car {
    void drive();
}

Step 2: Create Concrete Products
-----------------------------------
public class Swift implements Car {
    public void drive() { System.out.println("Swift driving..."); }
}

public class Baleno implements Car {
    public void drive() { System.out.println("Baleno driving..."); }
}

Step 3: Create Factory Class
-------------------------------
public class CarFactory {

    public static Car getCar(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("swift")) {
            return new Swift();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("baleno")) {
            return new Baleno();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

Step 4: Client Code
--------------------
Car car = CarFactory.getCar("baleno");
car.drive();

➤ Client does not know how objects are created → loose coupling achieved.

🧩 Factory Pattern UML Structure
**********************************
➤ Creator (Factory Class)
➤ Contains Factory Method (getObject())

➤ Product Interface (Common Parent)
➤ Car

➤ Concrete Products
➤ Swift
➤ Baleno

➤ Client
➤ Calls the factory

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Less coupling between client and objects
➤ Centralized object creation
➤ Code becomes more maintainable
➤ Follows Open/Closed Principle
➤ Helpful when object creation is complex

🧩 Disadvantages
********************
➤ More classes (Factory + Product classes)
➤ Sometimes adds unnecessary abstraction
➤ Switch/if-else can grow if many products are added
➤ (But can be fixed using more advanced patterns like Abstract Factory or Factory Method Pattern with inheritance)

🧩 Variations of Factory Pattern
***********************************
1) Simple Factory (Not part of GoF, but commonly used)
=========================================================
➤ A single factory class with logic to create objects → the one we wrote above.

2) Factory Method Pattern (GoF)
================================
➤ Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
➤ Uses inheritance

3) Abstract Factory Pattern
==============================
➤ Creates families of related objects
➤ Example: UI themes (DarkThemeButton, DarkThemeCheckbox)

🧩 Interview Questions (Very Common)
***************************************
➤ What is the Factory Method Pattern?
➤ How is it different from Abstract Factory?
➤ Why not use constructors directly?
➤ What problem does Factory solve?
➤ Where is Factory used in Java?
➤ How does Factory support OCP?
➤ Can Factory return different objects based on configuration? (Yes)

############################################
🧩 Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern 
############################################
🧩 Definition
****************
➤ The Chain of Responsibility (CoR) is a Behavioral Design Pattern that allows you to pass a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides:
➤ whether to process the request, OR
➤ pass it to the next handler in the chain.

➤ This pattern decouples the sender and receiver and avoids if-else/switch ladders.

🧩 Intent (Why Chain of Responsibility?)
******************************************
➤ To avoid tightly coupling request sender and receiver.
➤ To allow multiple objects a chance to process a request.
➤ To build flexible and dynamic chains of handlers.
➤ To replace long if-else conditions with clean handler objects.

🧩 Real-World Examples
************************
➤ Customer support escalation
➤ Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3
➤ ATM withdrawal handler
➤ Authentication filters in web security
➤ Logging frameworks (INFO → DEBUG → ERROR)
➤ Servlet filters in Java EE
➤ Spring Boot Handler Interceptors / Filter Chains
➤ Exception handling chain

🧩 When to Use CoR Pattern?
******************************
➤ When multiple handlers can process a request.
➤ When you want to remove large conditional blocks.
➤ When handlers should be dynamically arranged.
➤ When requests need to be processed or forwarded without knowledge of the receiving handler.

🧩 Key Characteristics (Must Know for Interviews)
****************************************************
➤ Each handler has a reference to the next handler.
➤ Request moves step-by-step through the chain.
➤ Handler can:
➤ Handle the request
➤ OR pass it along
➤ OR do both
➤ Follows Open/Closed Principle → new handlers can be added easily.
➤ Decouples sender from receiver.

🧩 Structure (UML Essentials)
********************************
➤ Handler (abstract class / interface)
➤ Defines method to handle request
➤ Has reference to next handler

➤ Concrete Handlers
➤ Implement the actual logic
➤ Decide to handle or forward

➤ Client
➤ Creates and links handlers
➤ Sends request to the first handler

🧩 Java Example — Support Ticket Chain
****************************************
1) Handler Interface
---------------------
public abstract class SupportHandler {
    protected SupportHandler next;

    public void setNextHandler(SupportHandler next) {
        this.next = next;
    }
    public abstract void handleRequest(String issueLevel);
}

2) Concrete Handlers
-----------------------
public class Level1Support extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String issueLevel) {
        if (issueLevel.equals("LOW")) {
            System.out.println("Level 1 handled the issue");
        } else if (next != null) {
            next.handleRequest(issueLevel);
        }
    }
}

public class Level2Support extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String issueLevel) {
        if (issueLevel.equals("MEDIUM")) {
            System.out.println("Level 2 handled the issue");
        } else if (next != null) {
            next.handleRequest(issueLevel);
        }
    }
}

public class Level3Support extends SupportHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(String issueLevel) {
        if (issueLevel.equals("HIGH")) {
            System.out.println("Level 3 handled the issue");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Issue cannot be handled!");
        }
    }
}

3) Client Code
---------------
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SupportHandler l1 = new Level1Support();
        SupportHandler l2 = new Level2Support();
        SupportHandler l3 = new Level3Support();

        l1.setNextHandler(l2);
        l2.setNextHandler(l3);

        l1.handleRequest("MEDIUM");
    }
}

🧩 Output
===========
Level 2 handled the issue

🧩 Advantages
***************
➤ Eliminates long if-else chains
➤ Easy to add new handlers
➤ Loose coupling between sender and receiver
➤ Follows SRP (each handler has its own logic)
➤ Flexible — order of handlers can be changed at runtime

🧩 Disadvantages
******************
➤ Request may go unhandled if chain ends
➤ Debugging can be difficult due to indirect flow
➤ Performance overhead if chain is long
➤ Needs careful ordering of handlers

🧩 Common Interview Questions
*******************************
➤ What is Chain of Responsibility?
➤ How does it reduce coupling?
➤ Difference between CoR and Decorator?
➤ Can handler both process and forward the request?
➤ Real-world examples of CoR?
➤ How is it implemented in frameworks like Spring/Servlets?
➤ What happens if no handler processes the request?

🧩 Difference: Chain of Responsibility vs. Decorator
*******************************************************
➤ CoR passes request along a chain → only one may handle.
➤ Decorator adds additional behavior → all decorators execute.

############################
🧩 Builder Design Pattern 
############################
🧩 Definition
****************
➤ The Builder Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern used to construct complex objects step-by-step.
➤ Instead of using a large constructor with many parameters, Builder provides a flexible, readable, and controlled way to create objects.

🧩 Intent (Why Builder Pattern?)
**********************************
➤ To avoid telescoping constructors (constructors with too many parameters).
➤ To create objects with optional or mandatory fields clearly.
➤ To construct complex objects step-by-step.
➤ To build immutable objects safely.

🧩 Where Builder is Used in Real Life?
****************************************
➤ Creating objects with multiple attributes
➤ Building immutable classes (e.g., in Lombok @Builder)
➤ Creating HTTP requests (OKHttp, Retrofit)
➤ JDBC PreparedStatement building
➤ Spring MockMvcBuilders
➤ StringBuilder in Java uses a similar but not exact pattern

🧩 Problem Without Builder (Telescoping Constructor)
*****************************************************
public class User {
    public User(String name, String email, int age, String address, String phone) {
        // too many params → confusing
    }
}

➤ Hard to read
➤ Hard to maintain
➤ Error-prone

🧩 Solution: Builder Pattern
********************************
🧱 Step-by-Step Object Construction
=====================================
➤ Builder allows you to set only the fields you need.
➤ Gives chained methods (fluent API).
➤ Final object is built using .build().

🧩 Complete Java Example
-------------------------
1️⃣ Class to Build
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private int age;
    private String address;

    private User(UserBuilder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.email = builder.email;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.address = builder.address;
    }

    public static class UserBuilder {
        private String name;
        private String email;
        private int age;
        private String address;

        public UserBuilder setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }

        public UserBuilder setEmail(String email) {
            this.email = email;
            return this;
        }

        public UserBuilder setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public UserBuilder setAddress(String address) {
            this.address = address;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}

2️⃣ Client Code
User user = new User.UserBuilder()
                .setName("Deepak")
                .setEmail("deepak@mail.com")
                .setAge(22)
                .build();


🧩 How Builder Improves Code
******************************
➤ Readable: Field names appear during object creation
➤ Flexible: Optional fields can be ignored
➤ Immutable: Object built is final
➤ Clean API: No messy constructors
➤ Scalable: Easy to add new fields

🧩 When to Use Builder Pattern?
*********************************
➤ When object has more than 4–5 parameters
➤ When object has optional parameters
➤ When object construction should be controlled step-by-step
➤ When creating immutable objects
➤ When construction logic is complex

🧩 Advantages
**************
➤ Avoids telescoping constructors
➤ Increased readability
➤ Helps create immutable objects
➤ Cleaner and maintainable code
➤ Flexibility in object creation

🧩 Disadvantages
*******************
➤ More code due to builder class
➤ Slightly more memory usage
➤ More classes to manage

🧩 Builder vs Factory vs Constructor (Interview Favorite)
*************************************************************
➤ Constructor:
➤ Simple, use when parameters < 3

➤ Factory:
➤ Decides which object to create

➤ Builder:
➤ Decides how to construct the object step-by-step

🧩 Real-World Examples in Java
********************************
➤ StringBuilder, StringBuffer (similar idea)
➤ java.lang.ProcessBuilder
➤ Lombok @Builder
➤ Stream.Builder<T>
➤ Calendar.Builder

🧩 Common Interview Questions

#############################
🧩 Decorator Design Pattern 
#############################
🧩 Definition
***************
➤ The Decorator Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern used to add new functionalities to an object dynamically, without modifying its original class.
➤ Decorators wrap an object and add extra behavior before/after delegating calls to the original object.

🧩 Intent (Why Decorator Pattern?)
************************************
➤ To extend functionality dynamically at runtime.
➤ To avoid subclass explosion (too many subclasses for combinations of features).
➤ To add responsibilities to an object without changing existing code (follows OCP).
➤ To decorate (wrap) an object with additional features.

🧩 Real-World Examples
*************************
➤ Java I/O Streams
➤ BufferedInputStream wraps FileInputStream
➤ DataInputStream, BufferedReader, ZipInputStream
➤ Spring Boot Filters (decorating request/response)
➤ Adding toppings to pizza (Cheese, Peppers, Olives)
➤ Text formatting (bold, italic, underline decorators)
➤ Logging wrappers
➤ Enhancing service layer with cache/log decorators

🧩 Where to Use Decorator Pattern?
************************************
➤ When you want to add new behaviors to objects dynamically
➤ When subclassing is impractical due to too many combinations
➤ When you want to follow Open/Closed Principle
➤ When you want to wrap a class with extra logic

🧩 Key Characteristics (Must Know for Interviews)
***************************************************
➤ Uses composition (wrap object) instead of inheritance.
➤ Decorator HAS the same interface as the original component.
➤ New behavior can be added before/after delegating calls.
➤ Multiple decorators can be stacked.
➤ Helps avoid too many subclasses.

🧩 Structure (UML Overview)
*****************************
➤ Component (Interface)
➤ Base interface for both core objects and decorators

➤ Concrete Component
➤ Actual object you want to decorate

➤ Decorator (Abstract class)
➤ Implements Component and has a reference to the wrapped Component

➤ Concrete Decorators
➤ Add new behavior

➤ Client
➤ Wraps objects with decorators

🧩 Java Example — Coffee Shop (Classic Decorator Example)
**********************************************************
1️⃣ Component Interface
=========================
public interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double getCost();
}

2️⃣ Concrete Component
======================
public class BasicCoffee implements Coffee {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Basic Coffee";
    }
    public double getCost() {
        return 50;
    }
}

3️⃣ Decorator (Abstract)
=========================
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;
    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }
}

4️⃣ Concrete Decorators
========================
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 10;
    }
}

public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }
    public double getCost() {
        return coffee.getCost() + 5;
    }
}

5️⃣ Client Code
===============
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new BasicCoffee();
        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);

        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: " + coffee.getCost());
    }
}

Output:
Basic Coffee, Milk, Sugar
Cost: 65.0


🧩 Advantages
**************
➤ Add functionality at runtime
➤ No need to modify existing code
➤ Flexible — combine decorators in any order
➤ Avoids class explosion
➤ Follows Open/Closed Principle & Single Responsibility Principle

🧩 Disadvantages
******************
➤ Many small classes (one per decorator)
➤ Debugging can be tricky due to multiple wrapping layers
➤ Order of decorators matters
➤ Complexity increases if too many decorators are used

🧩 Decorator vs Inheritance (Interview Favorite)
**************************************************
➤ Inheritance
➤ Static behavior
➤ Compile-time
➤ Adds functionality to entire class

➤ Decorator
➤ Dynamic behavior
➤ Runtime
➤ Adds functionality to a single object instance

🧩 Decorator vs Chain of Responsibility
******************************************
➤ Decorator
➤ All decorators execute
➤ Used to enhance (add behavior)

➤ CoR
➤ Only one handler might handle
➤ Used to pass request along a chain

🧩 Common Interview Questions
******************************
➤ What is Decorator Pattern?
➤ How is it used in Java I/O?
➤ Difference between Decorator and Adapter?
➤ Decorator vs Inheritance?
➤ Can decorators be nested?
➤ Real-life example?

############################
🧩 Adapter Design Pattern 
############################
🧩 Definition
****************
➤ The Adapter Pattern is a Structural Design Pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
➤ It acts as a bridge between an existing class and a client that expects a different interface.

➤ In simple words:
Adapter converts one interface into another interface expected by the client.

🧩 Intent (Why Adapter Pattern?)
***********************************
➤ To reuse old/existing code with a new system without modifying it.
➤ To allow incompatible classes to communicate.
➤ To wrap a class with a different interface that the client understands.
➤ To follow Open/Closed Principle — extend behavior without modifying existing code.

🧩 Real-World Examples
***********************
➤ Mobile charger adapter — Converts 220V to 5V
➤ Card reader — SD card to USB
➤ HDMI-to-VGA converter
➤ Java Collections API
➤ Arrays.asList() → Adapts array to List
➤ Spring Web
➤ HandlerAdapter allows controllers of different types to work
➤ Legacy system integration

🧩 When to Use Adapter Pattern?
**********************************
➤ When you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match your requirements.
➤ When you want to integrate new code with a legacy system.
➤ When you need to convert data formats or APIs.
➤ When you follow the “don’t modify existing code” principle.

🧩 Types of Adapter
*********************
➤ Object Adapter (Most common)
➤ Uses composition
➤ Adapter contains the adaptee object

➤ Class Adapter
➤ Uses inheritance
➤ Adapter inherits from Adaptee (not common in Java because Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance)

🧩 Structure (UML Essentials)
*******************************
➤ Target Interface → What client expects
➤ Adaptee → Class with incompatible interface
➤ Adapter → Converts the request to the Adaptee’s format
➤ Client → Uses Target interface

🧩 Java Example — Adapter Pattern (Mobile Charger Analogy)
*************************************************************
1️⃣ Target Interface (What client expects)
===========================================
public interface Charger {
    void chargePhone();
}

2️⃣ Adaptee (Existing incompatible class)
==========================================
public class HomeSocket {
    public void provideElectricity() {
        System.out.println("Providing 240V electricity");
    }
}

3️⃣ Adapter (Converts 240V → 5V)
================================
public class ChargerAdapter implements Charger {
    private HomeSocket socket;

    public ChargerAdapter(HomeSocket socket) {
        this.socket = socket;
    }

    @Override
    public void chargePhone() {
        System.out.println("Adapter converting 240V to 5V...");
        socket.provideElectricity();
        System.out.println("Phone is charging safely");
    }
}

4️⃣ Client Code
===============
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HomeSocket socket = new HomeSocket();
        Charger charger = new ChargerAdapter(socket);
        charger.chargePhone();
    }
}

Output
Adapter converting 240V to 5V...
Providing 240V electricity
Phone is charging safely

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Reuse existing code without modifying it
➤ Improves reusability
➤ Increases compatibility between old and new code
➤ Supports Open/Closed Principle
➤ Flexible — you can wrap many adapters around the same adaptee

🧩 Disadvantages
******************
➤ Adds extra layer — may increase complexity
➤ Too many adapters can make the system hard to understand
➤ Not suitable if you can modify the existing class — in that case, refactoring is simpler

🧩 Adapter vs Decorator vs Proxy
************************************
➤ Adapter → Converts interface
➤ Decorator → Adds new behavior
➤ Proxy → Controls access (security, lazy load, logging)

🧩 Real Java Examples
***********************
➤ Arrays.asList()
➤ InputStreamReader(InputStream)
➤ ResourceAdapter in Spring
➤ JDBC driver wrappers
➤ Log4j to SLF4J bridges

🧩 Iterator Design Pattern
############################
➤ Definition
**************
The Iterator pattern provides a standard way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its internal structure.

🧩 Key Points
****************
➤ Type: Behavioral Pattern
➤ Focus: Traverse collections (List, Set, Trees, Custom collections) in a uniform way
➤ Goal: Hide the complexity/structure of the underlying data representation

🧩 Intent
***********
➤ Provide a common interface to iterate over a collection.
➤ Allow multiple types of iteration (forward, backward, custom traversal).
➤ Decouple traversal logic from collection class.

🧩 Where It Is Used in Java
******************************
➤ Java’s Iterator, ListIterator, Iterable interfaces.
➤ Enhanced for-loop (for (int x : list)) internally uses Iterator.
➤ Collection classes (ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList) all use it.

🧩 Structure (Conceptual)
***************************
➤ Iterator
 ➤ Provides operations like hasNext() and next()
➤ ConcreteIterator
 ➤ Implements iteration over a specific collection
➤ Aggregate / Iterable
 ➤ Creates an iterator
➤ ConcreteAggregate
 ➤ Returns an iterator for the collection

🧩 Simple Java Example
*************************
Collection (Aggregate)
interface Container {
    Iterator getIterator();
}

Iterator Interface
interface Iterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    Object next();
}

Concrete Collection
class NameRepository implements Container {
    private String[] names = { "John", "David", "Sara" };

    @Override
    public Iterator getIterator() {
        return new NameIterator();
    }

    private class NameIterator implements Iterator {
        int index = 0;

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return index < names.length;
        }

        @Override
        public Object next() {
            return hasNext() ? names[index++] : null;
        }
    }
}

Usage
NameRepository repo = new NameRepository();
Iterator it = repo.getIterator();

while (it.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(it.next());
}

🧩 Real-World Examples
************************
➤ TV remote channels — press next/previous without knowing stored channel list
➤ Music playlist — iterate songs sequentially
➤ Browser history — go forward/backward

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Uniform traversal across different collections
➤ Encapsulation — hides internal structure
➤ Multiple iteration algorithms possible
➤ Supports parallel or custom iterators

🧩 Disadvantages
*******************
➤ Extra classes (Iterator, ConcreteIterator) increase complexity
➤ Multiple iterators on the same collection may cause concurrency issues

🧩 When to Use
***************
➤ You want to iterate without exposing internal data structure.
➤ You want to support multiple traversal types (reverse, filtered, custom).
➤ You want clean separation between collection and traversal logic.

🧩 Interview Questions
************************
➤ Why do we need Iterator when we have simple loops?
➤ Difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
➤ Why is Iterator.remove() preferred over modifying during iteration?
➤ Fail-fast vs Fail-safe iterator in Java?
➤ Internal working of foreach loop in Java?

############################
🧩 Observer Design Pattern
############################
➤ Definition
**************
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (Subject) changes its state, all its dependents (Observers) are notified automatically.

🧠 Why Is It Used? (Intent)
*****************************
➤ To achieve loose coupling between objects.
➤ To ensure automatic updates to subscribers when the data changes.
➤ To support event-driven systems.

🔧 Where Is It Used? (Real-Life Examples)
*********************************************
➤ YouTube Subscription → When a channel uploads a video, all subscribers get notified.
➤ Stock Market Apps → Investors get alerts when stock price changes.
➤ GUI Listeners → Button click listeners, keypress listeners.
➤ Weather App Updates.

🏗️ Core Components
********************
➤ Subject (Observable)
👉 Stores the list of observers
👉 Notifies observers on state change

➤ Observer
👉 Gets updates from the subject
👉 Defines the update() method

➤ Concrete Subject
👉 Implements maintaining & notifying observers

➤ Concrete Observer
👉 Reacts to subject updates

🧱 UML Structure (Simple View)
*********************************
Subject --------> Observer
  |                 ↑
  | notify()        |
  | add/remove      |
ConcreteSubject     |
  | state           |
ConcreteObserver ----

💻 Java Example (Note-Making Friendly)
***************************************
1. Observer Interface
======================
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

2. Subject Interface
======================
interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer o);
    void removeObserver(Observer o);
    void notifyObservers();
}

3. Concrete Subject
====================
class YouTubeChannel implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String latestVideo;

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.add(o);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.remove(o);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer o : observers) {
            o.update(latestVideo);
        }
    }

    public void uploadVideo(String title) {
        this.latestVideo = title;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

4. Concrete Observer
=====================
class Subscriber implements Observer {
    private String name;

    public Subscriber(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void update(String video) {
        System.out.println(name + " got notified: New video uploaded -> " + video);
    }
}

5. Test
========
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        YouTubeChannel channel = new YouTubeChannel();

        Observer s1 = new Subscriber("Deepak");
        Observer s2 = new Subscriber("Aman");

        channel.registerObserver(s1);
        channel.registerObserver(s2);

        channel.uploadVideo("Design Patterns in Java!!!");
    }
}

⭐ When To Use Observer Pattern
*********************************
➤ When multiple objects depend on another object’s state
➤ When you want event-driven architecture
➤ When you want loose coupling between broadcaster and listeners

✅ Advantages
**************
➤ Loose coupling
➤ Easy to add new observers
➤ Supports event-driven programming
➤ Subject doesn’t need to know observer details

❌ Disadvantages
******************
➤ Too many notifications can cause performance overhead
➤ Observers might depend on update order
➤ Hard to debug due to complex chains

🎯 Interview Questions (Most Asked!)
**************************************
➤ What is the observer pattern and where is it used?
➤ Difference between Observer and Publish-Subscribe?
👉 Pub-Sub uses broker; Observer does not.
👉 In Observer, subject knows observers directly.

➤ Is Observer pattern synchronous or asynchronous?
👉 Classic implementation = synchronous
👉 Can be async using event queues

➤ Which design principle does it follow?
👉 Follows Open-Closed Principle
👉 Follows Loose Coupling Principle

###################################
🧩 Template Method Design Pattern
###################################
➤ Definition:
***************
The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton (template) of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

➤ Simple Meaning:
==================
Parent class = defines steps
Child class = customizes only required steps
Algorithm flow = fixed + controlled

🧩 Intent / Purpose
*********************
➤ Define the fixed flow of an operation once, while allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps.
➤ Promote code reuse and avoid duplicate algorithm structure.
➤ Enforce a consistent algorithm template.

🧩 Key Characteristics
************************
➤ Algorithm structure is fixed and cannot be changed by subclasses.
➤ Subclasses customize steps via abstract or hook methods.
➤ Follows Hollywood Principle — “Don’t call us, we’ll call you.”
➤ Defines a template method (final) in the parent class.

🧩 Structure (UML-like)
*************************
AbstractClass
   ├── templateMethod()  → final (algorithm steps)
   ├── step1() → abstract
   ├── step2() → abstract
   └── hook()  → optional override

ConcreteClassA / ConcreteClassB
   ├── implement step1()
   └── implement step2()

🧩 Real-Life Analogy
**********************
Making Tea vs Coffee
➤ Boil water (same)
➤ Add ingredients (different)
➤ Pour and serve (same)

The skeleton stays the same, but specific steps differ.

🧩 Java Example (Interview-Ready)
************************************
Step 1: Create Template 
-------------------------
abstract class DataProcessor {

    // Template method (the algorithm)
    public final void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        saveData();
        hook();        // optional customization
    }

    abstract void readData();
    abstract void processData();

    void saveData() {
        System.out.println("Saving processed data...");
    }

    // Hook method – optional
    void hook() {}
}

Step 2: Concrete Classes
-------------------------
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {

    void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading CSV data");
    }

    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing CSV data");
    }
}

class JSONDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {

    void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading JSON data");
    }

    void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing JSON data");
    }

    // Optional hook override
    void hook() {
        System.out.println("Validating JSON data");
    }
}

Step 3: Client 
----------------
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor processor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        processor.process();

        processor = new JSONDataProcessor();
        processor.process();
    }
}

🧩 When to Use Template Method
*********************************
➤ When multiple classes share the same algorithm structure.
➤ When certain steps should be customizable, but the sequence must remain the same.
➤ When you want to avoid duplicate code for algorithm flow.
➤ When you want to have hooks for optional behavior.

🧩 Advantages
***************
➤ Promotes code reuse and clean architecture.
➤ Reduces duplicate logic.
➤ Ensures algorithm consistency across implementations.
➤ Extensible — child classes customize only required steps.

🧩 Disadvantages
*******************
➤ More subclasses = more complexity.
➤ Changes in base algorithm affect all subclasses.
➤ Increases tight coupling between base class and subclasses.

🧩 Key Interview Questions
*****************************
➤ What is the Template Method pattern?
➤ Why is the template method declared final?
➤ What are hook methods?
➤ Difference between template method and strategy pattern?
➤ Real-world example in Java libraries?

🧩 Real Examples in Java
***************************
➤ java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream → read(), write() methods.
➤ javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet → doGet(), doPost() methods.
➤ Spring Framework uses templates (e.g., JdbcTemplate, RestTemplate).

##############################
🧩 Prototype Design Pattern 
##############################
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used when creating objects is costly, heavy, or complex, and you want to clone existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch.

🧩 Definition
***************
➤ Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying (cloning) existing objects.
➤ Instead of instantiating new objects using new, you clone a prototype, which acts as a template.

🧩 Why Do We Need It?
***********************
➤ When creating an object is:

👉 Expensive (e.g., connecting to DB, loading a file)

👉 Complicated (many steps/configurations)

👉 Time-consuming (e.g., parsing XML/JSON every time)

➤ Cloning avoids that overhead by copying an already prepared object.

🧩 Real-Life Analogy
***********************
➤ Think of a notary stamping documents.
Instead of writing a fresh document every time, the notary keeps a master copy and makes xerox copies (clones) whenever someone needs one.

🧩 Structure
***************
➤ Prototype interface → declares the clone() method
➤ Concrete Prototype → class that implements cloning
➤ Client → asks for a clone instead of creating a new object

🧩 Types of Cloning
➤ Shallow Copy

👉 Copies only object references
👉 Nested objects are shared

➤ Deep Copy

👉 Copies everything
👉 Nested objects are also duplicated

🧩 Java Example (Simple & Easy)
**********************************
🔹 Step 1: Create Prototype Interface
-----------------------------------------
public interface Prototype {
    Prototype clone();
}

🔹 Step 2: Concrete Prototype Class
-------------------------------------
public class Employee implements Prototype {
    private String name;
    private String department;

    public Employee(String name, String department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
    }

    @Override
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new Employee(name, department);   // deep copy
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " - " + department;
    }
}

🔹 Step 3: Client
-------------------
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee("Deepak", "Backend");
        
        Employee emp2 = (Employee) emp1.clone(); // cloning

        System.out.println(emp1);
        System.out.println(emp2);
    }
}

🧩 When to Use Prototype Pattern?
************************************
➤ When object creation is expensive or slow
➤ When the system should be independent of the object creation logic
➤ When you want to avoid subclassing just to create multiple object configurations
➤ When you need multiple similar objects quickly

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Fast object creation
➤ Avoids repetitive complex construction
➤ Reduces memory usage
➤ Less boilerplate than Factory/Builder in some cases

🧩 Disadvantages
******************
➤ Deep cloning can be complex
➤ You must handle circular references
➤ Not suitable if the object contains external resources (e.g., DB connections)

🧩 Interview-Ready Points
***************************
➤ Prototype pattern clones existing objects, reducing object creation cost
➤ Uses clone() method
➤ Supports shallow and deep copying
➤ Used when objects have complex initialization
➤ Common in:
👉 Game engines (cloning characters)
👉 Document editors (copy/paste)
👉 Frameworks requiring fast duplication

####################################
🧩 Abstract Factory Design Pattern
####################################
🧩 What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
******************************************
➤ The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
➤ It is basically a factory of factories — each factory creates related objects.

🧩 Why Do We Use It?
**********************
➤ When your system needs to create a set of related objects.
➤ When you want consistency among products (e.g., UI themes, OS-specific components).
➤ When you want to decouple object creation from usage.

🧩 Real-Life Analogy
*********************
➤ Think of a Furniture Store that sells:
    👉 Modern Chair, Modern Sofa
    👉 Victorian Chair, Victorian Sofa
➤ You first choose the factory (Modern Factory / Victorian Factory), and then you get related products.
➤ Each factory produces a family of consistent products.

🧩 Structure
***************
➤ AbstractFactory → Interface with methods to create product families.
➤ ConcreteFactory → Implements object creation.
➤ AbstractProduct → Interface for product.
➤ ConcreteProduct → Actual implementation.
➤ Client → Uses the factory but never knows the actual classes.

🧩 Code Example (Java)
************************
🎯 Goal: Create UI based on OS (Windows or Mac)
=================================================
// Abstract Product A
interface Button {
    void click();
}

// Abstract Product B
interface Checkbox {
    void check();
}

// Concrete Product A1
class WindowsButton implements Button {
    public void click() {
        System.out.println("Windows Button Clicked");
    }
}

// Concrete Product A2
class MacButton implements Button {
    public void click() {
        System.out.println("Mac Button Clicked");
    }
}

// Concrete Product B1
class WindowsCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void check() {
        System.out.println("Windows Checkbox Checked");
    }
}

// Concrete Product B2
class MacCheckbox implements Checkbox {
    public void check() {
        System.out.println("Mac Checkbox Checked");
    }
}

// Abstract Factory
interface GUIFactory {
    Button createButton();
    Checkbox createCheckbox();
}

// Concrete Factory 1
class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() {
        return new WindowsButton();
    }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new WindowsCheckbox();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory 2
class MacFactory implements GUIFactory {
    public Button createButton() {
        return new MacButton();
    }
    public Checkbox createCheckbox() {
        return new MacCheckbox();
    }
}

// Client
class Application {
    private Button button;
    private Checkbox checkbox;

    public Application(GUIFactory factory) {
        button = factory.createButton();
        checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
    }

    public void render() {
        button.click();
        checkbox.check();
    }
}

// Test
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GUIFactory factory = new WindowsFactory(); // or MacFactory()
        Application app = new Application(factory);
        app.render();
    }
}

🧩 Advantages
****************
➤ Ensures compatibility among created objects.
➤ Code becomes more flexible and decoupled.
➤ Makes adding new product families easy.

🧩 Disadvantages
*****************
➤ Adding new products (e.g., adding Slider component) requires modifying all factories.
➤ Increases number of classes.

🧩 When to Use Abstract Factory?
*********************************
➤ When products are created in groups/families.
➤ When system must not depend on product concrete classes.
➤ When you need runtime selection of the product family.

##########################
🧩 Facade Design Pattern
##########################
The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simple, unified interface to a complex subsystem.
It hides complexity and exposes only what is necessary.

📝 Definition
***************
➤ Facade pattern wraps complex libraries, frameworks, or multiple classes behind a single class
➤ That single class becomes a gateway for the client
➤ Client does not need to know the internals — only calls simple methods

🎯 Why Use Facade Pattern?
*****************************
➤ To reduce complexity when working with multiple dependent classes
➤ To improve readability & maintainability
➤ To decouple the client from the complex subsystem
➤ To avoid exposing unnecessary internal logic

🎮 Real-Life Analogy (Very Easy)
***********************************
👉 TV Remote
==============
Without a remote, you must manually operate TV, Set-top box, Home theatre, DVD Player, etc.
Remote provides only simple buttons → ON, OFF, Volume, Channel

It hides all complex circuits.

🔧 Example (Simple Java Code)
******************************
🎬 Subsystem classes (complex system)
---------------------------------------
class AudioSystem {
    void on() { System.out.println("Audio ON"); }
    void off() { System.out.println("Audio OFF"); }
}

class Projector {
    void on() { System.out.println("Projector ON"); }
    void off() { System.out.println("Projector OFF"); }
}

class Screen {
    void down() { System.out.println("Screen Down"); }
    void up() { System.out.println("Screen Up"); }
}

🎯 Facade class
------------------
class HomeTheatreFacade {

    private AudioSystem audio;
    private Projector projector;
    private Screen screen;

    public HomeTheatreFacade(AudioSystem audio, Projector projector, Screen screen) {
        this.audio = audio;
        this.projector = projector;
        this.screen = screen;
    }

    public void watchMovie() {
        screen.down();
        projector.on();
        audio.on();
        System.out.println("Movie Started!");
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        audio.off();
        projector.off();
        screen.up();
        System.out.println("Movie Ended!");
    }
}

🎮 Client (simple interaction)
--------------------------------
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HomeTheatreFacade theatre = new HomeTheatreFacade(
            new AudioSystem(),
            new Projector(),
            new Screen()
        );

        theatre.watchMovie();
        theatre.endMovie();
    }
}

💡 When to Use?
*****************
➤ When you want to hide complex logic behind simple APIs
➤ When working with third-party libraries
➤ When dealing with legacy systems
➤ When client should be independent of subsystem complexities

🧠 Key Interview Points
************************
➤ Facade simplifies API by providing a single entry point
➤ It does not restrict access — subsystem classes are still accessible
➤ It reduces coupling between client and subsystem
➤ It is different from Adapter —
👉 Adapter changes interface
👉 Facade simplifies interface
➤ Mostly used in frameworks (Spring, Hibernate)
